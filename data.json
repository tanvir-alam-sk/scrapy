Not to mention, there is no television in the room I was staying in. To make matters worse, the dorm room is cold, coupled with no heating. I honestly don't mind the cold most of the time but the room temperature is too cold for my liking.   Speaking of the ground floor, the Korean receptionist told me that I'm not allowed to eat my food at a table at the cafe and told me to climb the stairs all the way to the third floor in order to eat my food. It isn't fair, considering the receptionist with the short, dark hair tends to allow me to eat my food at a table at the cafe during the very early hours of the morning. I eventually lost my patience and yelled at the Korean receptionist. It's rare when I lose my patience. I threatened in a growly voice with, \u201dI suggest you fill the pot noodle to the top with water unless you want a scathing, negative review to be blasted on the radio for everyone to hear?\u201d. Finally, she got the memo.   The rooms, bathrooms and toilets and facilities are unsanitary (for example, there are biscuit crumbs all over the bed sheets. I didn't know until I got out of bed), the entire hotel itself is not accessibility-friendly as if the lack of a lift and the staff not being accommodating towards disabled people such as myself isn\u2019t of any indication, the kitchen and the kitchen equipment on the third floor are dirty, there is no hot water in some of the bathrooms within the dorm rooms, the bathrooms and the dorm rooms are shared (therefore, there is no privacy), the lights keep turning themselves off if you\u2019re idle (I\u2019m more used to turning on and off the lights on my own accord), you need to pay \u00a310 for a padlock which is complicated for disabled people and the list goes on. The toilets, bathrooms, kitchen etc are just as dirty as Badea Faulkner and Olive Allison Brown from the Avanzar House in Middleton, Manchester not cleaning up after themselves. And don\u2019t get me started on the staff being problematic. They aren\u2019t very useful to the point where I had to shout at them due to their language barriers and them not listening to me, let alone understanding me. This is troubling for autistic people like me. Never in all my years have I encountered such frustrating hotel staff members. Compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in the past, the hotel staff in these hotels were never infuriating.

We had a wonderful view of the park and the Eiffel Tower. The room is beautiful to look at, but a little damaged in some parts (for example the shower). The biggest problem of the room was the ventilation system, as it smelled of the drain several times. The cleaner does her job, as she cleans the room daily, but the problem is exclusively ventilation. I might also point out that you can hear the chairs being moved in the bar in the room. I would also suggest that a different choice of breakfast be made every day, as it was the same breakfast twice. However, I would like to conclude by praising the staff, who were friendly at all times.\",\"rating\":3,\"avatarImgUrl\":\"\"},{\"nickName\":\"Guest User\",\"regionCode\":\"\",\"content\":\"There are two major issues here:  1. It is extremely expensive for a hostel.   The highest price hostel I'd ever stayed in.   I paid 48 euros the first night and 60 euros for the second night.   For this sort of price you would at least expect a good night sleep.  2. If you came here to sleep, and it is is a weekend, you can forget about it.  You will get booming bass until around 4am.   Even earplugs don't work to drown on that noise.  On weekends there is a discotheque in the rooftop bar.   The rooftop bar belongs to the hostel so they don't even have the excuse that it is someone else's business.  It shows that they prioritise making money from drinks over the sleep and comfort of the 200 people in the hostel.    And speaking of the hostel, the rooms for 8 are pretty cramped, however at least the bunks are well designed, with curtains and electric sockets.  Breakfast is not worth it.  For 5 euros you get 2 supermarket croissants and a cup of filter coffee - not even a nice French espresso.  For 10 euros you get some supermarket quiche and some bread with nutella (and still no decent coffee).   You can however get an espresso or an allonge (americano) for 2 euros.   On the positive side the rooftop terrace cafe is really nice during the day.   You can visit it without staying here, which is what I'd advise.  Regarding the noise level:  you have been warned.  You should be okay on a weeknight or a Sunday. \",\"rating\":1,\"avatarImgUrl\":\"\"},{\"nickName\":\"Guest User\",\"regionCode\":\"\",\"content\":\"UNSAFE, DO NOT STAY HERE. ALLOWED A MAN TO ENTER OUR ROOM AT 3AM.  This last weekend (3/3-3/5), my friends and I stayed in a private room at The People. In the middle of the night, I was awoken by two men searching our luggage in our room. The staff had allowed a man to enter our room at 3am to retrieve a bag he had thought he had left prior to our arrival (he had not left anything & if he had one could assume the housekeepers would have removed it). The man would not leave until forcibly removed by us. The following morning, the receptionist, Julie told me she could not offer us any compensation for our safety being compromised on their property.  The manager was allegedly not working during the weekend and so I was only able to email him regarding the situation. It has been several days and I have not heard back from him.  Paris is full of similarly-priced hostels, don't waste your money staying at the People,  somewhere where your safety is not prioritized by management or staff. By purchasing a stay in a private room, my all-female group expected to feel safe and protected - we did not.

It's an easy 5min walk from King's Cross station, so the location is perfect. Its low-cost made me choose it over other London hostels. Check-in was a breeze and the staff are some of the friendliest I've met (and I'm a travel writer!). However there's room for improvement with the dorms. The dorms were almost clinical-like and while there's underbed storage, the corner ones were hard to use, especially when you're trying to be quiet in the morning. The worst thing about the hostel were the beds themselves. The bedding was so thin and uncomfortable I wondered if I'd ever get to sleep. Also the shelf above the bed means you can't sit upright (at least on the bottom bunks). Instead of a sink in the dorm there should be more washbasins in the shower room as it makes getting ready for the day harder than needs to be (and disruptive to other dormmates). Only two of the three showers on my floor were working and shower gel would be a simple and low-cost inclusion.
